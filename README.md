### Weather app

This app was made during the Kottans FrontEnd course. 
We had to implement a weather application using some weather API and a custom react-like framework. 
The framework was written by one of our mentors at the workshop, everything else, all components and layout, was done by myself. 
Maybe, later I will add autocompletion on the search field and save the app state and data using LocalStorage.
